# Photos Folder for Floating Photo Cubes

This folder contains the images that will be displayed on the floating photo cubes in your 3D scene.

## How to Add Your Photos

1. **Add your photos** to this folder (`public/photos/`)
2. **Name your photos** following this pattern:
   - `photo1.jpg`, `photo2.jpg`, `photo3.jpg`, etc.
   - The system expects JPG format, but PNG also works
   - Each cube needs 6 photos (one for each face)

## Photo Organization

- **Cube 0** uses: `photo1.jpg` through `photo6.jpg`
- **Cube 1** uses: `photo7.jpg` through `photo12.jpg`
- **Cube 2** uses: `photo13.jpg` through `photo18.jpg`
- And so on...

## Recommended Photo Specs

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Size**: 400x400 pixels (square works best)
- **File size**: Under 500KB for faster loading
- **Aspect ratio**: Square (1:1) for best results on cube faces

## Tips

- Use high-quality photos for best visual impact
- Consider the theme/color scheme of your site
- Photos will be automatically mapped to cube faces
- Missing photos will show as blank faces until added

## Example

If you want 3 cubes with custom photos, you would need:
- 18 photos total (6 photos × 3 cubes)
- Named: `photo1.jpg` through `photo18.jpg`
